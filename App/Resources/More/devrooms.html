<p>The FOSDEM team feels it is very important for free and open source software developers around the world to be able to meet in “real life”.</p>

<p>To this end, we have set up developer rooms (devrooms) with network/internet connectivity and projectors where teams can meet and showcase their projects. Devrooms are a place for teams to discuss, hack and publicly present latest directions, lightning talks, news and discussions. We believe developers can benefit a lot from these meetings.</p>
