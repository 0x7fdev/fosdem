<p>On Sunday afternoon, FOSDEM provides a free shuttle bus service from
the conference venue to <strong>Brussels South (Midi)</strong> railway
station which has a regular service to many popular destinations within
Belgium and to surrounding countries.</p>
<p>Five buses will provide the service between <b>15:30</b>
and <b>19:30</b>. The journey takes approximately 20 minutes.
The <a href="https://nav.fosdem.org/l/c:0:331.17:16.68/@0,332.08,81.15,0.14">departure location</a> is on the main road below the campus in front of
the AW building.</p>
<p>Between 15:30 and 17:15, a bus is scheduled to depart every 15
minutes. Based on previous experience, we expect the buses to be
busiest from 17:30 on. We will abandon our fixed schedule then with
buses departing as soon as they are full to maximize throughput. The
last departure will be at 19:30.</p>
<p>If you don't want to queue, why not leave later? There are plenty of
bars in the neighbourhood where you can pass the time!</p>
