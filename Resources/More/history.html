<p>In 2000, Raphael Bauduin, a fan of the Linux movement in Belgium, decided to organise a small meeting for developers of Open Source software. He called it 'Open Source Developersâ€™ European Meeting' (OSDEM).</p>

<p>Raphael created a mailing list, a small website and spread the word to people around him. Only a few weeks later, lots of people were waiting for an exciting event in Brussels! Invitations were sent to well-known figures in the community: Rasterman, Fyodor, Jeremy Allison and so on. They all gave a very positive response, and OSDEM was on the road to success.</p>

<p>For the second year, OSDEM was renamed FOSDEM. And now, many years later, it has grown into the event it is today. We now try to cover a wide spectrum of free and open source software projects, and offer a platform for people to collaborate. Every year, we host more than 5000 developers at the ULB Solbosch campus.</p>

<p>Raphael is no longer the driving force behind FOSDEM. After 7 years of hard work he left the team for new Open Source plans. The FOSDEM flag is now proudly carried by the following people:</p>
